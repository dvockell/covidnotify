Google Sheet Project to Notify Members of Positive Contact

When we begin to "open up" there will be lots of tracking solutions to reduce the magnitude of future outbreaks. Things like schools and movie theaters and the grocery store will have great, complex solutions to understand how a individual's positive COVID test needs to be reported to those exposed.

But many of our most valuable interactions are not through big companies -- it's your Boy Scout meeting, poker night, soccer practice...and they need a pretty simple solution if they need to contact their members.

We've built a Google Script to accompany a simple spreadsheet.

On one page of the sheet you can just track a list of meetings and who attended. 

In the event of positive notification, you select the REPORTING MEMBER and the REPORT DATE into the control page

You have the option of either contacting people that had DIRECT contact with the reporting member, or also those that had indirect contact (e.g., they contacted someone who had direct contact with the reporting member).

That's it. 

The setup is: 

1. Import the Excel file into Google Sheets or make a copy of: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VtQYDMrCE2QNl8mx6LPT4zAhutFEF5R5cuabzWwuSUA/edit?usp=sharing

2. Make yourself of copy of this Google Script (or create it from the file in this repository): https://script.google.com/d/1l0QKkbW01bCHJst_z6wmI9wWcnVDA22DERC598HBIRK2zo-hGS7NVfZD/edit?usp=sharing'

3. Put your Twilio settings inot the "Twilio Settings" tab of the Google Sheet

Usage: follow the instructions on the "Outreach" tab.
